# Google Shopping - Conditionals and Loops

We'll be using a file represented as **JSON** for this assignment. JSON is a standard for formatting data, and it's a common format you'll see throughout your web development career. Even more important will be parsing JSON.

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your computer
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Look in the starter file in `js`, called `google-shopping.js`. We'll be using Node to read the JSON file and access it as a JavaScript object
* Run the file by typing `node js/google-shopping.js` into the console. If you get items printing out, you're ready to start on the assignment.
  * Alternatively, `npm start` can also be used
  * Alternatively, you can also create a separate file for each problem. Keep in mind you'll want to use the `node` command instead of `npm start` when dealing with multiple files.

## Deliverables

Use the product search result in your file to find the following results. Note that you may want to comment out your solutions as you solve them, to avoid a mess of output in the terminal.

Remember to type `node js/google-shopping.js` to run the file (or `npm start`).

1.) Go through the `items` and find all results that have `kind` of `shopping#product`. Print the count of these results. Where else is this count information stored in the search results?

2.) Print the `title` of all items with a `backorder` availability in `inventories`.

3.) Print the `title` of all items with more than one image link.

4.) Print all "Canon" products in the items (careful with case sensitivity).

5.) Print all `items` that have an author name of "eBay" and are brand "Canon".

6.) Print all the products with their **brand**, **price**, and an **image link**


## Hints

* We'll be dealing with large JSON objects quite frequently throughout the course. Use a Chrome extension such as [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) in order to easily collapse arrays and objects during this assignment. Once the extension is installed, access the JSON file via Github by going to **products.json**, then clicking **Raw** right above the file.
* When in doubt, think about the different functions available for **strings**, **objects**, and **arrays**.
* Double-check your results, especially with #5
